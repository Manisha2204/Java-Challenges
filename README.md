# 🚀 Java Coding Challenge

Welcome to my **Java Coding Challenge** repository! 🎯
This is a personal journey where I solve **Java coding problems daily** to strengthen my problem-solving skills, practice clean code, and prepare for coding interviews.

Each day, I’ll be uploading a new Java program with:

* 📌 Problem statement
* 🖥️ Code solution
* ✅ Sample input/output

This challenge is **continuous**  — a way to **stay consistent with coding** and share my progress publicly.

## ✅ Problems Solved

### **Day 1 – String Reversal**

* **Challenge:** Reverse a string in Java without using `StringBuilder.reverse()`.
* **Approach:**

  * Took input with `Scanner`
  * Traversed string in reverse order
  * Printed each character one by one
* **Sample Run:**

  ```
  Input: my name is java  
  Output: avaj si eman ym
  ```

### **Day 2 – Palindrome Checker**

* **Challenge:** Check if a given string is a palindrome (same forwards & backwards) without using `StringBuilder.reverse()`.
* **Approach:**

  * Took input with `Scanner`
  * Converted string to lowercase
  * Built a reversed string manually using a loop
  * Compared original and reversed strings
* **Sample Run:**

  ```
  Input: mom  
  Output: Palindrome  

  Input: hello  
  Output: Not a Palindrome
  ```

### **Day 3 – Count Vowels, Consonants, Digits, and Spaces**

* **Challenge:** Count the number of vowels, consonants, digits, and spaces in a given string.
* **Approach:**

  * Converted string to lowercase
  * Checked each character using conditions
  * Maintained separate counters for vowels, consonants, digits, and spaces
* **Sample Run:**

  ```
  Input: Java 17 is Interesting!  
  Output:  
  Vowels: 7 
  Consonants: 10
  Digits: 2  
  Spaces: 3  
  ```
